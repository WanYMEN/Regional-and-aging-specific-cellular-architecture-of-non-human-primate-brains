The files whose names end in 'tar.gz' are raw nucleus versus gene UMI count matrices of the 39 samples.

The file 'count_data_meta_UMAP.rds' includes the filtered nucleus versus gene UMI count and data matrices, metadata and UMAP coordinates, which was integrated across the 39 samples.

The file 'macaque_scRNA_sample_info.txt' exhibits the information of the 39 samples.
