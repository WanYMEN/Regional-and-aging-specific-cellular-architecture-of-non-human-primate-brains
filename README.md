# Regional-and-aging-specific-cellular-architecture-of-non-human-primate-brains

The repository include the code for primary analyses performed in the paper "Regional and aging-specific cellular architecture of non-human primate brains".

The files "step1 preprocessing.txt", "step2 cellFilter.R" and "step3 harmony_integration.R" were pipelines for getting raw nucleus versus gene UMI count matrices from snRNA-seq raw data, filtering nuclei from each sample and integrating nuclei from all samples, respectively.

Pipelines for other primary analyses are listed with corresponding file names, such as "celltype_specific_genes.R" and "region_specific_genes.R" for identification of cell-type-specific and region-specific genes, respectively.
